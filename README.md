# Crime Statistics Canada

Concordia Data Science Bootcamp 2024-2025 Module 1 Capstone Project

Canada's reputation as a relatively safe and peaceful country in the developed world was one of the top reasons why I migrated to Canada 5 years ago. I have always been curious how this perception measures against actual crime statistics in Canada's major cities. hence, I chose this topic for my foray into exploratory data analysis using Python's data analytics libraries. 

I pulled crime statistics data of some major Canadian cities from Kaggle, which were in turn sourced from Statistics Canada and municipal police services. The dataset is not comprehensive enough to draw a meaningful conclusion on the perception and reality of crime in Canada; my goal was to get familiar and comfortable with using python libraries in piercing large datasets so that I can leverage it in my day job whenever the occassion arises. 

As for my lived experience in Canada, it has been great so far. Thankfully, I have not yet become a data point in these datasets!
